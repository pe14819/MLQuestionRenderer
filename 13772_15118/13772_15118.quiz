    "workings": "Selecting the first two data points as test data, we find the 1-Nearest-Neighbour to them for classification. The data point (1,2) is 2 units away from (1,4), which is the closest point to it. This therefore classifies it as No Night Vision. We have the same case for (2,3), where using Euclidean Distance we find the point (1,4) to be closer (root 2 units away) than the point (4,3) (2 units away). We therefore classify both of these data points correctly as No Night Vision, leading to 100% accuracy for this fold. We then take the next 2 test data points (2,5) and (1,4). The data point (1,4) is closest to (2,3) being root 2 units away and hence is classified as No Night Vision. This data point is classified correctly. The data point (2,5) is closest to the point (3,5) with a 1 unit distance, and hence is classified as Night Vision. This data point is not classified correctly because when it was used in the training set it was given a classification of No Night Vision. We therefore have 50% accuracy for this fold. Using the next 2 test data points (3,5) and (4,3), we can see the point (3,5) is closest to the point (2,5) with a distance of 1 giving it a classification of No Night Vision. This is an incorrect classification. The data point (4,3) is closest to the point (5,4) with a distance of root 2, giving it a classification of Night Vision. This is a correct classification. Therefore, this fold has an overall accuracy of 50%. We have the last 2 test data points (5,4) and (6,2). The data point (5,4) is closest to the point (4,3) with a distance of root 2. This gives a correct classification of Night Vision. The data point (6,2) is closest to the point (4,3) with a distance of root 5, giving it a correct classification of Night Vision. This therefore gives an accuracy of 100% for this fold. Averaging the accuracy from each fold gives us a final overall accuracy for our 1-Nearest-Neighbour classifier. (50 + 100 + 50 + 100) / 4 = 75%. The answer is therefore 75%.",

    "comments": "This question tests your knowledge on the k-NN classifier and cross-validation. We believe that this question is a level 3 difficulty because it requires involved reasoning and calculations. We have to give reasoning when using 1-NN why data points are classified as Night Vision or No Night Vision. We have to calculate the Euclidean Distance between points to choose the classification, and calculate the accuracy of each fold of cross-validation to then produce the final answer of the average accuracy between the folds."

You have to reason how you have classified each leaf using the majority class classifier to turn the feature tree into a decision tree. You also have to reason what counts as a true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative. Once this has been done, you can calculate the true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives using the decision tree, and fill in all the contingency table. we thought it could possibly be a level 3 difficulty because you actually have to use a classifier to create a model and then use this model to calculate the true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives, and then fill in the contingency table, but opted for a level 2 to reduce the chance of a penalisation."

For instance the experts can be replaced with classifiers. Continuation of this question would be to look into the randomised weighted majority algorithm which guarantees to perform as well as the best performing expert. Unfortunately this could not be asked in this question because the random aspect would cause variation in the answers. We believe this is a level 5 difficulty because Online Learning is mentioned in the epilogue as a machine learning topic that isn't included in the book. It also requires involved reasoning, as to when we penalise weights and assess predictions. It also requires involved calculations using the weighted majority algorithm, calculating new weights using $\\beta$."

    "hint": "First classify by using 3-NN, then assess confidence levels using the distance to the points in its class, and then add the two instances with the highest confidence levels to the labelled data and re-train.",
    "workings": "The first thing to do is to classify the unlabelled data points according to the model trained with the current labelled data. We will use summed distance to the two nearest neighbours as our confidence level. for the first stage that gives us the following table.<br><br><img src=\"img/13772_15118/cOUTOFBOOK_q7_answer1.png\"><br><br>Therefore the 2 points we are most confident on are (2,1) and (5,4) so these are now inserted into the training data. The second cycle creates this table.<br><br><img src=\"img/13772_15118/cOUTOFBOOK_q7_answer2.png\"><br><br>You can clearly see the two closest points are (2,2) and (3,5), and these are subsequently added to the training data. We now run the algorithm a final time to include the last two points, classifying them as their majority class in 3NN.<br><br><img src=\"img/13772_15118/cOUTOFBOOK_q7_answer3.png\"><br><br>You can see how this classification has differed from the first classification as the point (1,4) is now classified as a positive, this gives clear intuition as to how including non labelled data can refine the decision boundaries of a model.",

    "comments": "Integrating unlabelled data via the self learning algorithm gives a better view of the actual decision boundary and so creates a better model. This is a small taster into the sub topic of semi labelled data. Semi labelled data is an important topic of machine learning as it allows us to learn from cheaper data. If this is something that interest you try looking into more complex algorithms such as co-training and the expectation maximisation approach. This question tests your knowledge of using semi-supervised algorithm of self-learning, where we have ranked this a level 5 - this topic is mentioned within chapter 1 but stated that it is not covered within the book. It requires involved calculations including calculations of distances and the use of 3-NN, with involved reasoning of the use of 3-NN and why the data chosen is used when re-training the whole data set."
